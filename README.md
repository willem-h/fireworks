# Fireworks Alert

View a list of upcoming firework displays near you and optionally add alerts so
that you can be prepared. (Maybe think about adding alerts for lightning and
thunder later on.)

Primarily built for dog owners so they can keep a closer watch on their dog who
might be prone to running off when startled.

Defaults to Brisbane CBD or postcode 4000 and a 10km radius. Shows all the
available upcoming fireworks displays in chronological order. First iteration
could just pull the ones in from the postcode/s of interest.

Other ways to help fix this problem:
- Ensure dog is microchipped and details are up to date
